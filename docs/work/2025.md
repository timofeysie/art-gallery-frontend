## Fixing Row-Level Security (RLS) Error in Supabase

After implementing the JWT token on the backend, adding a gallery shows this error: AddGallery.tsx:37: POST http://localhost:3000/gallery/galleries 500 (Internal Server Error)

I see this in the NestJS terminal:

```sh
ped {/gallery/galleries, POST} route +1ms
[Nest] 37996  - 10/03/2025, 9:36:26 am     LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started +3ms
Server is running on port 3000
[Nest] 37996  - 10/03/2025, 9:38:12 am   ERROR [ExceptionsHandler] new row violates row-level security policy for table "galleries"  
```

The request header does have the bearer set: authorization:
Bearer eyJhbGciO...

This error is related to Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, not an authentication issue. Your JWT token is being correctly sent to the backend, but the database operation is being blocked by RLS.

1. Configure RLS Policies in Supabase
You need to create appropriate RLS policies that allow authenticated users to insert data.
2. Use Service Role in NestJS Backend
If you want to bypass RLS entirely for backend operations.
3. Modify Your Gallery Service to Include User ID
If you want to maintain RLS but allow users to create their own galleries.

Recommended Approach
For most applications, Option 3 is the best approach because:

- It maintains proper security by enforcing RLS
- It associates galleries with specific users
- It follows the principle of least privilege

This option involves passing the id through the controller to the service layer, and running this SQL in the SQL Editor in Supabase:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own galleries" 
ON galleries
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

The user ID comes from the validated JWT token, not from user input.

I altered the policy "Users can create galleries"
on "public"."galleries"
to authenticated
with check (
  (auth.uid() = user_id)
);

I replaced: ```(auth.uid() = user_id)``` with ```auth.uid()::text = user_id::text```.

Here is the output after the 500 error:

```sh
Server is running on port 3000
User from JWT: {
  userId: '417402c3-cde2-4aa3-81b1-304a9a1a90a8',

```

The issue might be that auth.uid() in Supabase isn't returning what we expect. Let's create a test function to see what Supabase thinks the current user ID is.

To debug this issue:

```sql
-- Create a function to return the current user ID
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_auth_uid()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.uid()::text;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create an API endpoint to call this function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_current_user_id()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN get_auth_uid();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

The error from supabase is:

```json
{
    "code": "42P01",
    "details": null,
    "hint": null,
    "message": "relation \"public.get_current_user_id\" does not exist"
}
```

This error indicates that the function `get_current_user_id` does not exist in the `public` schema.

To fix this, we need to create the function in the `public` schema.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_current_user_id()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.uid()::text;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

In Supabase, unauthenticated users have the role anon while authenticated users have the role authenticated.  These are PostgreSQL roles used for RLS policies.

Unfortunately, when the profile table was created, it overloaded the "role" concept with app roles such as guest or admin.

Options to Fix the Situation

Option 1: Keep the Current Structure but Clarify Usage
Option 2: Use Service Role for Backend Operations
Option 3: Add a New Field for Application Roles

We went with option 1, but had to make a big change with the way that

### Implementing the Service Role Approach

Based on the table structure, everything looks correct - you have a user_id column of type UUID that's not nullable, which matches what we're trying to insert. Since we've tried multiple approaches with RLS policies and are still encountering issues, let's implement the service role approach as a reliable solution.

We add the following to the .env file: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

Then on the backend, change the Supabase service:

```js
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { createClient, SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

@Injectable()
export class SupabaseService {
  private supabase: SupabaseClient;
  private serviceClient: SupabaseClient;

  constructor() {
    this.supabase = createClient(
      process.env.SUPABASE_URL || '',
      process.env.SUPABASE_KEY || '',
    );
    
    // Add the service client with the service role key
    this.serviceClient = createClient(
      process.env.SUPABASE_URL || '',
      process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY || '',
    );
  }

  getClient(): SupabaseClient {
    return this.supabase;
  }
  
  getServiceClient(): SupabaseClient {
    return this.serviceClient;
  }
}
```

And in the gallery.service,

```js
try {
    // Use service client to bypass RLS
    const { data, error } = await this.supabaseService
    .getServiceClient() // Use service client instead of regular client
    .from('galleries')
    .insert(galleryWithUser)
    .select()
    .single();
    
    if (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Error creating gallery: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
    throw error;
    }
    
    return data;
} catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Exception creating gallery: ${error.message}`);
    throw error;
}
```

This solves the situation.

#### Security Considerations

Using the service role bypasses RLS entirely, which means your backend becomes responsible for all authorization checks. This is a common pattern in many applications, where:

- The frontend authenticates users and sends requests with JWT tokens
- The backend validates the JWT tokens and performs authorization checks
- The backend uses elevated privileges to interact with the database

To maintain security:

- Never expose the service role key to the frontend
- Always validate user permissions in your controllers/services
- Log all operations for audit purposes
